# Vocal For Local

### Vocal for Local is an E-commerce website built specifically for local businesses to increase their reach in the market and bloom their business.
The need for a online portal where local businesses could sell their products and customers could buy these products from the comfort of their home was at a peak during the time of Covid-19, which was the time when this project was implemented.

In this website a seller can be given the access to add new products and view/deliver orders. A customer can select the products they wish to buy and pay for them using Stripe Payments.
